# For VMs, I prefer to mount shared folders on the host using SMB instead of
VMware's HGFS. (The permissions are not wide open if I use SMB.) To mount the
share, you will need to install cifs-utils, mkdir the mount point, and run the
following command:

sudo mount -t cifs //<host>/<folder> /mnt/<host>/<folder> -o username=<username>
