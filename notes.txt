# For VMs, I prefer to mount shared folders for Windows hosts using SMB instead
of VMware's HGFS. (The permissions are not wide open if I use SMB.) Make the
folder on the host "Shared", by right clicking, choosing Properties->Sharing,
and enable sharing for a only myself. To mount the share, you will need to
install cifs-utils, mkdir the mount point, and run
the following command:

sudo mount -t cifs //<host>/<folder> /mnt/<host>/<folder> -o username=<username>
